<b> What COVID-19 vaccines have been approved and how do they work? </b>
<br> Currently, several COVID-19 vaccines are in clinical trials. The FDA will review the results of these trials 
<br> before approving COVID-19 vaccines for use. But because there is an urgent need for COVID-19 vaccines 
<br> and the FDA's vaccine approval process can take months to years, the FDA will first be giving emergency use 
<br> authorization to COVID-19 vaccines based on less data than is normally required. The data must show that 
<br> the vaccines are safe and effective before the FDA can give emergency use authorization. 
<br><br><i> Vaccines with FDA emergency use authorization include:</i>
<br>
<br>
<br><b> Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine </b>
<br> This vaccine has an efficacy rate of 95%. 
<br> This means that about 95% of people who get the vaccine are protected 
<br> from developing symptoms of the COVID-19 virus. 
<br> This vaccine is for people age 16 and older. It requires two injections given 21 days apart. 
<br> The second dose can be given up to six weeks after the first dose, if needed.
<br><br><b> Moderna COVID-19 vaccine </b>
<br> This vaccine has an efficacy rate of 94.1%. 
<br> This vaccine is for people age 18 and older. It requires two injections given 28 days apart. 
<br> The second dose can be given up to six weeks after the first dose, if needed.
<br><br><br> Both the <b><i> Pfizer-BioNTech </b></i> and the <b><i> Moderna COVID-19 </b></i> vaccines use messenger RNA (mRNA). 
<br> Coronaviruses have a spike-like structure on their surface called an S protein. 
<br> COVID-19 mRNA vaccines give cells instructions for how to make a harmless piece of an S protein. 
<br> After vaccination, your cells begin making the protein pieces and displaying them on cell surfaces. 
<br> Your immune system will recognize that the protein doesn't belong there 
<br> and begin building an immune response and making antibodies.
